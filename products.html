          <h2>Rafflesia Arnoldii</h2>
          <p>Known to be the world’s largest flower, this plant is one of the rarest one in the world. Rafflesia Arnoldii, also known as the corpse plant, this name was given to this plant because of its foul odour that is similar to decaying flesh. Unlike other flowers, this plant doesn’t have a pleasant smell and you can find this flower in the dense rain-forests of Sumatra, Indonesia, Malaysia and Bengkulu.</p>

            <h2>Encephalartos Woodii</h2>
            <p>One of the rarest plants in the world is the Encephalartos Woodii which is now conserved and restricted to the botanical garden only where it was transported from Zululand. This plant is found in South Africa and is considered being extinct in the wild with all specimens being clones of the type. Its cycad variety had both male and female plants, but long ago there was no specimen of female plants found. That’s why there is no propagation and the male plant is now conserved.</p>
